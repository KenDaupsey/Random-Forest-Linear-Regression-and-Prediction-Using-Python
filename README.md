# Random-Forest-Linear-Regression-and-Prediction-Using-Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest Regression model for predicting continuous outcomes, such as academic performance scores. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about students' academic performance, including reading, writing, math, and social studies scores. It splits the data into training and testing sets, and then trains a Random Forest Regression model on the training data. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the mean squared error is calculated to evaluate its performance. Additionally, the project displays feature importances, visualizes the first decision tree in the random forest, and provides a textual representation of that tree.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
graphviz
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn graphviz matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, split the data into training and testing sets, train the Random Forest Regression model, make predictions on the test set, calculate the mean squared error, display feature importances, visualize the first decision tree in the random forest, and provide a textual representation of that tree.
